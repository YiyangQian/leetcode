 * Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}'
 *
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep
 * copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a
 * list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * {"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
 * Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 * Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
 * Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
 * The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no
 * self-loops in the graph.
 * Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q
 * must have node p as neighbor too.
 * You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned
 * graph.
